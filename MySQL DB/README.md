- `Citizen`: Stores information about citizens who can make requests and offers.
- `Items`: Stores information about items available for requests and offers.
- `Warehouse`: Manages item quantities in the warehouse.
- `Requests`: Manages requests made by citizens for specific items.
- `RequestItems`: Manages the items and quantities associated with each request.
- `Offers`: Manages offers made by citizens to provide specific items.
- `OfferItems`: Manages the items and quantities associated with each offer.
- `Vehicles`: Manages vehicles assigned to rescuers for delivering items.
- `VehicleItems`: Manages the items and quantities associated with each vehicle.

## Test Data

The `test_data.sql` file provides sample data to populate the database for testing purposes. It includes sample administrators, rescuers, citizens, items, requests, and offers.

## How to Use

1. **Setup Database:**
   - Create a new MySQL database.
   - Run `db_schema.sql` to create the database schema.
   - Run `Procedures_Trigers.sql` to add the stored procedures and triggers.
   - Run `test_data.sql` to populate the database with sample data.

2. **Configure PHP Application:**
   - Update the database connection settings in your PHP application to connect to the MySQL database.
   - Use the provided database schema and procedures to handle requests, offers, and other operations in the application.

3. **API Integration:**
   - Create PHP scripts to interact with the database using the defined schema and procedures.
   - Implement API endpoints to manage disaster relief operations, such as creating requests, assigning rescuers, updating statuses, and more.

## Example API Endpoints

- `POST /api/requests`: Create a new request.
- `POST /api/offers`: Create a new offer.
- `GET /api/requests`: Retrieve a list of requests.
- `GET /api/offers`: Retrieve a list of offers.
- `PUT /api/requests/:id/assign`: Assign a request to a rescuer.
- `PUT /api/requests/:id/status`: Update the status of a request.
- `PUT /api/offers/:id/assign`: Assign an offer to a rescuer.
- `PUT /api/offers/:id/status`: Update the status of an offer.
